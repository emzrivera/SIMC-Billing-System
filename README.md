🏥 Billing System 

This is a group project for ITMC321: SYSTEMS INTEGRATION AND ARCHITECTURE FOR IT PROFESSIONALS, where we are developing a Billing System for St. Ignatius Medical Center and integrating it with other hospital subsystems.

📌 Project Description
Our system focuses on automating the billing process in a hospital setting. It allows staff to generate invoices, track payments, apply insurance discounts, and view revenue trends. The system will be integrated with the Prescription Management System (PMS), Patient Records Management System, and HMO System.

Features:

💵 Billing & Invoicing
Generate detailed bills with clear breakdowns of services, medications, and HMO discounts.

📊 Payment Tracking & History
View pending, partial, and completed payments. Keep transaction history for reference.

📈 Revenue Reporting
